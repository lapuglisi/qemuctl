*** qemuctl/boot
!!! UEFI boot: make a copy of OVMF.whatever to machine's directory and use
it as a read-write pflash

***** qemuctl/runtime
!! Log rotation

** validate machine status through pid file - OK
** add in the future options to define the cpu topology (sockets, core, etc)
** add audiodev option (when needed; mostly GUI guests)
***** qemuctl/actions
-- perhaps create some 'reflect' feature to use action names and get respective action
-- OR
-- create a base action and derive everything else from them (golang is not actually fond of inheritance, like c++)
--- for that, we could set the 'Run' method of the base action as type 'func ([]string) error'
